   "source": [
    "Part of `numpy`'s efficiency comes from the fact that the algorithms used behind the scenes are tuned to be as efficient as possible by dedicated computer scientists.\n",
    "Another reason that the code is efficient is that large chunks of the code are written in *C* and *C++* rather than in Python.\n",
    "A pre-compiled *C* or *C++* function is called by NumPy to execute your code, and the results are passed back to you in Python. \n",
    "It is not necessarily important to understand why this is more efficient, but it is important to point out that it is done in this manner because it is more efficient than strictly using Python.\n",
    "They are playing 4-dimensional chess while you are playing checkers, metaphorically, so there is no use in reinventing the wheel with respect to creating homemade functions.\n",
    "\n",
    "A final reason that NumPy is so efficient is the introduction of the `numpy.array`.\n",
    "The `numpy.array` is a generic $n$-dimensional array object.\n",
    "The easiest way to think about it is that a `numpy.array` is an $n$-dimensional matrix which can be used to store and manipulate your data or just do simple matrix and vector algebra.\n",
    "The reason this object is more efficient than the standard Python `list` is how the memory is stored in each case.\n",
    "In a standard `list` all of the members are stored in random spots in memory, so when they need to be accessed, the computer has to search around for them.\n",
    "In a `numpy.array` all of the data points are stored in sequential memory.\n",
    "This means that if you are at a point in your array, `my_array[a][b][c]`, and want to access the adjacent piece of data, `my_array[a][b][c + 1]`, the computer can just access the adjacent memory address instead of searching through all of the memory for the correct piece of data.\n",
    "In the previous example, `my_array` designates a 3-dimensional array, as seen by the three different indexes following the `my_array` call.\n",
    "Most functions in NumPy are built around manipulating these objects and are coded in such a way as to take advantage of the memory allocation in an optimal way, making them very efficient.\n",
    "\n",
    "In order to demonstrate the power of NumPy, we can start with the standard dot product. In the code block below, we generate two vectors of length 10,000 and store them in `numpy.array` objects and `list` objects. We create a generic function, `my_dot_0`, that takes the dot product of two input vectors using a standard for loop. We then time the output.  "
