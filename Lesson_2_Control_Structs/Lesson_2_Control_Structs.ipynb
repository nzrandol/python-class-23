    "2. Let's go back to the dose-finding clinical trials. We have a list of doses that we want to test: `dose_list = [1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13]`. We want to increase the dose until we hit the maximal tolerated dose (MTD). For simplicity, we will increase the dose when less than two of the three patients have toxicity and stop otherwise. The last dose before at least two patients have toxicity will be declared the MTD. Suppose we already know how many patients will have toxicity at each dose: `tox_list = [0, 0, 1, 1, 2, 2]`. Try finding the MTD using a `while` loop."
